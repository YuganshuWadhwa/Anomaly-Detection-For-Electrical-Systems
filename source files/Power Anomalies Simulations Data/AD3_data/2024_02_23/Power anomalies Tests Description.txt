======   Power anomalies Tests Description  =====


1. Power failure – A total loss of utility power.

Value   =    5V      -    0v    -      5v
Time    =   20sec    -   10sec  -     20sec   		



2. Power sag – A short term low voltage.
 
Value   =     5 V    -   3.5v  -      5v
Time    =    20sec   -   5sec  -     20sec   		



3. Power surge (spike) – A short term high voltage above 110 percent normal voltage.

Value   =   3.5 V    -    5v    -     3.5v
Time    =   10sec    -   20sec  -     10sec   		




4. Under-voltage (brownout) – Reduced line voltage for an extended period of a few minutes to a few days. 
   This often happens during the summer months when people set their air conditioners higher than normal.


Value   =     5 V    -     4v   -      5v
Time    =    10sec   -   20sec  -     10sec   		




5. Over-voltage – An extended period of increased line voltage for a few minutes up to a few days.

Value   =     3.5 V   -    5v   -      3.5v
Time    =    10sec   -   20sec  -     10sec   		




6. Electrical line noise – A high frequency waveform caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) 
    or electromagnetic interference (EMI).



Value   =     5 V / 50Hz  -     5v  / 50Hz with 10kHz noise signal    -      5v  / 50Hz 
Time    =       20sec     -                    10sec                  -     20sec   		





7. Frequency variation – A change in frequency stability of 50 or 60 Hz.


Value   =     5 V / 50Hz  -    5v  / 60Hz   -      5v  / 50Hz 
Time    =       20sec     -      10sec         -     20sec   		


8. Switching transient – Instantaneous undervoltage measured in nanoseconds.




9. Harmonic distortion – The distortion of a normal power wave, generally transmitted by nonlinear loads.
